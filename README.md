Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front-running bots sniping profits across exchangeâ€™s pools.

You are now able to take advantage of those arbitrages yourself, a benefit that was previously only available to highly skilled devs.

Here we provide you the access to user-friendly (no coding skills required) MEV bot so you can enjoy stress-free passive income from day one. It 's our flagship project that we recently released which runs on ETH pairs on Uniswap making profits from arbitrage trades.

Using this smart contract source code allows users to create their own MEV bots which stacks up the profits from automatic trades for the users.

We share this Arbitrage MEV bot smart contract for free.
